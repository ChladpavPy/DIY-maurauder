# DIY-Marauder
A custom-built control and macro interface based on the Seeed XIAO RP2040 microcontroller.

Key Project Features:

Microcontroller: Driven by the RP2040 for high performance and easy programming.

Hardware Compatibility: The PCB layout is specifically designed to be pin-to-pin compatible with the Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3. This allows the user to easily swap the RP2040 for an ESP32 module if Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functionality is required for future Marauder firmware updates.

User Interface: Features two mechanical MX-switches, an EC11 rotary encoder, and an 0.91" OLED display for real-time feedback.

Design Status: Fully routed PCB with generated manufacturing files (Gerbers) and a 3D-printable enclosure designed in Fusion 360.
